    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is <strong>Ankush Kumar</strong>, and I am a passionate and motivated
        <strong>web development enthusiast</strong> who enjoys building clean, modern,
        and user-friendly websites. I am currently focused on learning and improving
        my skills in <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, and I love turning simple
        ideas into functional and visually appealing web experiences.
    </p>

      <br>
      
    <p>
        I started my journey in web development out of curiosity about how websites
        work behind the scenes. Over time, this curiosity turned into a strong interest
        in designing layouts, writing clean code, and creating responsive interfaces
        that work smoothly across different devices. I believe that a good website is
        not only about design but also about usability, performance, and accessibility.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        As a learner, I enjoy working on real-world projects such as personal portfolios,
        small web applications, and interactive UI components. These projects help me
        strengthen my problem-solving skills and understand how different technologies
        work together. I am always eager to explore new tools, frameworks, and best
        practices that can help me grow as a developer.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        Apart from technical skills, I value <strong>consistency, discipline, and
        continuous learning</strong>. I actively practice coding, experiment with new
        features, and try to improve my understanding of core programming concepts every
        day. I am comfortable working independently and also enjoy collaborating with
        others, as it helps me learn new perspectives and improve my communication skills.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        My long-term goal is to become a <strong>professional full-stack developer</strong>
        and contribute to meaningful projects that solve real-world problems. I am
        looking for opportunities where I can apply my skills, gain practical experience,
        and continue learning in a challenging and supportive environment.
